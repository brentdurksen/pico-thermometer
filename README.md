# Pico Thermometer

A very simple REST endpoint app in MicroPython to return the temperature from a Pi Pico W with a DS18B20 temperature sensor.

## Development

Recommend using [MicroPico](https://github.com/paulober/MicroPico) with VS Code for development.

Install the extension, then run **Configure Project** in the project directory from the command palette to set up
completions and linting.
